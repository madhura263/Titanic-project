# Titanic-project
A basic Machine Learning project where the survival chances of the Titanic passengers are predicted using various ML algorithms.
In this project I have used the Kaggle Titanic dataset for prediction of survival chance of passengers on the Titanic. Various features were used for finding correlation of them with the survival chance using data visualization and then various machine learning models were used for making the predictions.
The detailed report can be found in the repository.
